# Introduction

A thread pool is a technique that allows developers to exploit the concurrency of modern processors in an **easy** and **efficient** manner. It's easy because you send "work" to the pool and somehow this work gets done without blocking the main thread. It's efficient because threads are not initialized each time we want work to be done. Threads are initialized once and remain inactive until some work has to be done. This way we minimize the overhead.
